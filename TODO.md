- [ ] #now microsync remote doesn't work.  I think this is because in schedule requesting hot uses recent_touch, but that is ONLY updated in scan, so only remotely, not in the local mirror.  We maybe need to update recent_touch also in the local mirror

- [ ] mutagen like top-level cli -- current one is very low level
